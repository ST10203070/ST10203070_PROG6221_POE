Changes based on the lecturer's feedback:

Given the lecturer's feedback, I changed the main method of the Program class. I broke the tasks up into methods to limit the amount of code in the main method. The main method now has one object instantiation and two method calls. I also fixed all the logical issues that were present in the code. There were many warnings that I had not addressed in Part 1. Finally, I made sure the software displays the data which was an issue due to the logical errors.
